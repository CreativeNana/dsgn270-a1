# The Kinjo Sushi & Grill site analysis #
Written by Na Young Lee

I would like to analyze the mobile and web site of Kinjo Sushi & Grill restaurant based on visual hierarchy, mental models and usability, and mobile responsiveness.


### Introduction
**My first impression** of the Kinjo Sushi & Grill website's visuals is that they tried to incorporate the restaurant’s brand identity into online channels by utilizing **intense red color** and **the Shojumaru font** similar to the appearance of the restaurant’s building. 

**The site's key goals** are **restaurant promotion** and **online ordering**. They try to reflect the unified visual identity with their offline restaurant on their online sites to provide a consistent experience to their customers. They also are applying hybrid channel methods that allow customers to pick up at offline stores or link external delivery services after receiving orders through online, and have plans to continue to grow, such as expanding offline stores in the future. 


### 1. Visual Hierarchy
The Nielsen Norman Group defines a visual hierarchy as follows:
> “Visual hierarchy controls the delivery of the experience. If you have a hard time figuring out where to look on a page, it’s more than likely that its layout is missing a clear visual hierarchy.”

I analyzed visual hierarchy by reference *'11 Principles of Visual Hierarchy'*. Although they have used certain factors effectively, there are still things to improve.

-	The factors that are being used effectively are **'size and scale'**, **'alignment'**, and **'the rules of thirds.'** For example, on the landing page we can clearly see the text image of Kinjo Sushi & Grill. To promote their brand names, they highlight large red-colored sizes in the introduction. Also, except for some information areas such as addresses, Text is aligned to the left. In addition, the list-type screens like news are designed in 3x3 grids.

-	On the other hand, **'perspective'** and **'typography'** need to improve. For example, in perspective, the largest text on a landing page overlaps over a colored image, making it difficult to read. Also, in the case of typography, the screen became rather distracting by using too much red and bold writing for emphasis.


### 2. Mental Models and Usability
In terms of usability, there are three things that cause inconvenience to customers and violate conventions. 
- First, there are **unnecessary screen links**. The loading speed is slow, and when you click the main logo on the homepage, it refreshes the landing page again. 
- Second, it is **a lack of shortcut images**. For example, it provides most menus or functions except SNS channels in text only. 
- Last, there is **an inconsistent screen transition**. When moving to the online order screen, clicking "Online Order" in the menu area moves the screen within the current site, and clicking the order menu linked to the main image area opens a new window to move. 

In the case of content, even though the amount of content is not large, it does not show the content effectively. 
- The distinction between keywords, titles, key information, and sub-information should be reinforced, and **avoid repeating the same sentences** in the title and body. 
- In addition, for menus, users need to **zoom in and out on the full image** to view the detailed menu by placing it on the full image rather than individual menus. 

From the perspective of accessibility, body text is mostly readable and supports the **screen reader** function. However, in some cases, the **contrast ratio** between the brand name and the background image of the landing page was **about 2:1, making it less readable**.


### 3. Mobile Responsiveness
Mobile also provides all the services available on the web. There is **a scroll track** on the mobile device, and a hamburger menu style is applying. While it has **not yet been bookmarked for use in QR codes**, it has a function to receive online orders through mobile devices.


### Conclusion
To sum up, the Kinjo Sushi & Grill site is an online ordering channel linked to offline stores, with positive aspects including offline-linked visual identity reflection, web accessibility configuration. On the other hand, it has improvement points in terms of usability, performance improvement, consistent screen configuration, and the latest technological service like QR code for taking into account the mobile environment.
